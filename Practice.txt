1)  Create a Student class. A Student has a name, username, and id number. 
    A student's constructor should take a name and username.

2)  Add a static field to the Student class to keep track of id numbers, id numbers should begin at 100000. 
    Each time a new student is created set the new student's id number and increment the static variable.

3)  Implement an equals and toString method for a student. 
    Two students are equal if they have the same username. 
    A student string should follow the formatting "<name> (<username>)".

4)  Write a main method that opens the students.txt file and creates a Student for each line in the file and adds them to an array. 
    The first line of the file says how many students are in the file, the following lines consist each consist of one Student in the form "<username>:<name>". 
    Be sure to catch any io exceptions that might be thrown and print a meaningful message.

5)  Create a recursive static method that takes an array of students and an index and prints all the students from the given index to the end of the array.
    Update your main to use this new method to print the array of students you created in step 4.
